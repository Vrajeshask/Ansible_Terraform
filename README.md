Terraform and Ansible in #AzureDevops, I AM USING TERRAFORM TO DEPLOY A VM AND USING ANSIBLE TO CONFIGURE IT (NGINX SERVER).

1)Install Required Tools:
Install Terraform on your local machine.
Install Ansible on your local machine.

2)Set up your Azure DevOps Environment:
Create a new project or use an existing one in Azure DevOps.
Set up a Git repository to store your Terraform and Ansible code.

3)Configure Azure Provider in Terraform:
Create a main.tf file in your Terraform project.
Configure the Azure provider in the main.tf file with necessary authentication details.

4)Define Azure Resources:
Define the Azure resources you want to provision (e.g., virtual network, subnet, NIC, VM) in your Terraform code.

5)Write Ansible Playbooks:
Write Ansible playbooks to configure the VM after provisioning.
Include tasks like installing packages, setting up users, configuring services, etc., as required.

6)Configure Terraform to Use Ansible Provisioner:
Use the null_resource and local-exec provisioner in Terraform to execute Ansible playbooks.
This involves creating a local-exec provisioner in your Terraform code to run Ansible playbooks after VM creation.

7)Set up Azure DevOps Pipeline:
Create a new pipeline in Azure DevOps.
Configure the pipeline to connect to your Git repository.
Create pipeline stages for different tasks (e.g., Terraform deployment, Ansible configuration).
Add appropriate tasks in each stage (e.g., checkout Git repository, run Terraform commands, execute Ansible playbooks).

8)Define Variables and Secrets:
Define variables for your Azure credentials, resource names, etc., in your Azure DevOps pipeline.
Use Azure DevOps pipeline secrets to securely store sensitive information like passwords or API keys.

9)Run the Pipeline:
Trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to run automatically on specific events (e.g., code push to Git repository).

10)Monitor and Troubleshoot:
Monitor pipeline execution for any errors or failures.
Debug and troubleshoot any issues encountered during the provisioning and configuration process.

11)Verify the VM:
Once the pipeline completes successfully, verify that the VM is provisioned and configured as expected.
